# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions
This repository is a collection of my solutions for 2024's AoC, written in JavaScript.

## Running the solutions
In order to run a solution for a specific day, simply run `npm run dayX`, with `X` being the day number. For example, to run the solution for day one, you would run `npm run day1`. These scripts to run the solutions are in the `package.json`.
