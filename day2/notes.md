## Reflection
I didn't really have any notes for this one, I just went ahead and started to write the solution.

This solution taught me that it is better to figure it out a bit before I start writing, as my solution at the time was prone to a lot of edge cases. If I would have taken the time to flesh out what I really needed to do, this wouldn't have been the case and I would've solved it a lot faster.
